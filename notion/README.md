notion keybindings and austere look
===================================

I strongly prefer the logic of this keybinding scheme to the default:

To move between visible objects, alt + direction.  To move from a
visible to an invisible object, alt + shift + same.

Thus, movement between frames is with alt + vim keys \[hjl\] (k is still the ion
metakey), and movement between objects within a frame is alt + shift + \[hl\].
Likewise alt + tab cycles between screens, and alt + shift + tab cycles
workspaces.

The rest of the bindings should be roughly similar to ion2.
