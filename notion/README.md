notion keybindings and austere look
===================================

The idea behind the key bindings is that movement between frames is with alt +
vim keys \[hjl\] (k is still the ion metakey).  Movement between objects within
a frame is alt + shift + \[hl\].  Alt + shift + tab cycles workspaces.
Mnemonic: The movement keys with shift change what is visible, the movement
keys without shift just change focus.  Alt + tab by itself used to switch
between monitors in a multi-screen X configuration, before the xrandr days.
The rest of the bindings should be similar to ion2.
